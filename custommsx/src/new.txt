Updated relize OCM on DE1 from 17.04.17
---------------------------------------
Added work with PS2-mouse.
Implemented the work of a mouse connected to the joystick
port according to the standard adopted for MSX.
While the mouse is working without a wheel.
By default, the mouse works through the port of the joystick 1.
The DE1 board does not provide for the connection of an
additional PS/2 device, so to connect the mouse you will
need to assemble the part of the scheme shown on the site.
