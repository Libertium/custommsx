This directory contains only the synthesizable part of the OpenCores 16750 UART. 

The full design can be downloaded from http://www.opencores.org

Many thanks to Sebastian Witt for making this core freely available.

The core seems to synthesize with the default simulation FIFO, you might want to investigate 
this to make sure you are meeting timing.
